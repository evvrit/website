    <p>Knitting a sweater is an arduous process. The planning stage alone for a project of that size can take hours, before any wool is on the needles. After you've made decisions about the construction, size, colour, yarn, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_(knitting)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gauge</a>, you have to collect the materials, sometimes costing hundreds of dollars. Then come the stitches, thousands upon thousands of them. Sometimes, you wrap up a project only to discover on the first wear that the material irritates your skin.</p>
    <p>Given the labour, it's surprising that even the most novice knitters feel the pull to make something for someone else. Nothing as big as a sweater - a pair of mittens here, a hat there. They only take a couple of weeks and balls of yarn to make.</p>
    <p>But gain enough momentum, and you may find yourself yearning to make a  <b>boyfriend sweater</b>*.</p>
    <div class="img-container"><img src="assets/boyfriend-sweater.webp" alt="moby sweater man, a pattern by petite knit"></div>
    <p>It's Christmas! It's his birthday! It's your anniversary! It's an occasion that would really pop off if you presented him with a handmade garment, made to fit his proportions, in his colours. What better way to express dedication and care, while looking supremely competent?</p>
    <p>If knitting a sweater is one ordeal, knitting a sweater for a typical male body is two. Larger measurements demand more time and more materials. Often the fit is trickier to get right because a female knitter is more familiar with designs tailored to the female body. This will likely require making costly mistakes, "frogging" (unraveling) hours of work, and trying again.</p>
    <p>A guy I knew broke up with his girlfriend after he quit smoking because he realized his "cigarette breaks" had actually been "girlfriend breaks". I imagine knitting a sweater for your boyfriend provides an analogous stress-test. You might love him a lot, but I'll bet that those of his ingratitudes which rot deepest in your stomach rush to the surface when you are picking up neckline stitches <i>for the third time.</i></p>
    <p>I don't know; I've never done it.</p>
    <p>Picture this: you've spent months knitting a sweater for your boyfriend, you cast off, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_(textile_arts)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">block</a> it, and finally give it to him. He loves it. It fits him well, the colours suit him, and he reports that the material feels comfortable. He wears it in and out of the house and it doesn't seem like he does so for your sake. Phew!</p>
    <p>Some time passes, maybe one month or two, and then <small id="boom">BOOM</small> you break up. An emotional time in its own right is made all the more devastating by the not-distant-enough memory of "sleeve island" (iykyk). To him, that sweater becomes a reminder of you, his ex. To you, that sweater is a casualty of war. In your nightmares, it is crumpled in a corner chair, or worse, felting in the wash.</p>
    <p>One thing knitters love to do, perhaps even more than knitting, is talk about knitting. Go to <a href="https://youtube.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">youtube.com</a>. Search "knitting podcast". Click any video. Learn more about latvian braids and the yarns Connie used in 2025 than you thought there was to learn.</p>
    <p>Naturally, if the misfortune of an ex-boyfriend running away with non-refundable hours of your life befalls you, you'd be (understandably) inclined to complain. In doing so, you invite other stories like yours.</p>

    <p>And so, I presume, it was born: the boyfriend sweater curse.</p>
    <p>For the most part, knitters only playfully nudge that knitting a sweater for your boyfriend signs your star-crossed fate. But it happens often enough that it has a name and a reputation. And I think there is some truth to it.</p>
    <p>There are, of course, counter-examples. Occasionally, multiple sweaters have been knit for the same boyfriend. <small>(I don't have the data, but wouldn't it be fun if I did?)</small></p>
    <p>I love that the boyfriend sweater curse exists. It expands the knitter's admittedly small area of focus to include the context in which she knits. I wonder what lore is hiding in other niche subcultures! If you develop a photograph of your lover in bed, do you invite an unplanned pregnancy? If you home-brew a craft beer the day before an important event, is it sure to explode?</p>
    <p>The thing about gifting knits is it puts a lot of pressure, not just on the knitter, but on the recipient. The labour is felt (hehe). The risk is enormous. Many smiles have been forced and harsh wools endured.</p>
    <p>A knitter always knows, by the way. We know because the things we've made have incited our own miserable terror, too.</p>
    <p>To be clear, I don't suspect the sweater is the cause of the split; that would have to be a pretty bad sweater. But the motivation <i>behind the urge</i> to make the sweater might hint at something important. It might be...grasping. A hand-knit sweater, lovingly made, at great personal expense, can completely miss the mark.</p>
    <p>It reminds me of a series of posts I saw on Twitter, when it was still Twitter and I still used it. One of my favourite bloggers (who shall remain nameless) gushed frequently about his wife. At first it seemed sweet, then as a pattern emerged, it started to seem odd. He weaved seemingly out-of-place compliments into his posts like he was reporting to duty. It read as insincere and subtly suffocating. Not a year later, they were divorced.</p>
    <p>I'm pretty sure lots of people want their partner to publicly boast about them and it doesn't signal an issue in the relationship. Similarly, I think a hand-knit sweater is a formidable gift - something of a calibre bounds above most of the slop you'll give and receive in your life.</p>
    <p>But loving requires listening and paying attention to the actual needs of the relationship, and noticing when what it needs is not at all a slightly scratchy sweater that occupies most of your evenings for two months. Your partner might need you to look up from your lap and take a heartfelt interest in their projects. They may just need a hug.</p>
    <p>Anything done as a blind and desperate attempt to save a relationship is indeed <i>a sign of an existing curse</i> on that relationship. As such an act draws attention to the direness of circumstances, it invites a snuffing out of whatever tired flame whimpers from the pit of a dying love.</p>
    <p>Simply <i>considering</i> knitting a sweater for your boyfriend is an instructive thought experiment if you pay keen attention to your motives. Under a really compelling guise, that bespoke sweater can be the most generic, lazy, self-serving demonstration of a thing approximating love. It's too easy to fool yourself into believing you are being the best partner you can be when you're slaving over a dense fabric, counting and recounting stitches, wondering where you went wrong.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 7rem;">If I ever do it, I'll let you know how it goes. For now, I'm sticking to <a href="socks.html">socks</a>.</p>

    <small>*Note: I am making generalisations about gender, because it's called "the <i>boyfriend</i> sweater curse" and I haven't heard any equivalents for differing relationship configurations. You can call anyone of any gender your boyfriend, as long as they're into it.</small>
